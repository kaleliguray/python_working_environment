### Prerequisites üéí

- For IDEA: PyCharm IDEA || Anaconda || Jupyter Notebook
- Language: Python

### Installation 

<ol type="1">
  <li>Pyhton Installation path - please follow <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">download link</a></li>
  <li>Anaconda Installation <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html">download link</a></li>
  <li>PyCharm - The Python IDE for data science and web development - installation path: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=mac">download link</a></li>
</ol>

> **_NOTE_** PyCharm is an IDE built using Java. Therefore, to run PyCharm, you need to install Java first. If Java is not installed on your computer, you may encounter a 'no JRE found' error message. To resolve this issue, you must install Java on your computer.

## Python

<p align="justify">Now, it's time to explore some basic Python concepts such as variables, data types, loops, and functions. You can find examples and explanations for
these topics in the repository. Python is a versatile language with many applications. Take your time to experiment with different code snippets, explore
Python libraries, and work on small projects to reinforce your learning.</p>

<p aling="justify">Features</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>Python File Extension = .py</li>
  <li>Script Language</li>
  <li><b><i>Simple and Easy to Learn:</i></b> Python is designed to be simple and easy to read, write, and understand. Its syntax is clear and concise, making it an ideal language for
    beginners.</li>
  <li><b><i>Interpreted Language:</i></b> Python is an interpreted language, which means that code is executed line by line. This allows for faster development as code can be tested and 
    executed quickly.</li>
  <li><b><i>High-level Language:</i></b> Python is a high-level language, which means that it abstracts away low-level details such as memory management and hardware interaction. This 
    makes it easier to focus on solving problems rather than dealing with technical details.</li>
  <li><b><i>Dynamic Typing:</i></b> Python is dynamically typed, which means that variable types are inferred at runtime. This allows for more flexibility and ease of use, but it also 
    requires careful attention to variable types to avoid errors.</li>
  <li><b><i>Object-Oriented:</i></b> Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. This allows for the creation of modular 
    and reusable code, making it easier to manage and maintain large projects.</li>
  <li><b><i>Functional Programming:</i></b> Python also supports functional programming concepts such as higher-order functions and lambda expressions. This allows for the creation of 
    concise and expressive code, particularly when working with collections and data processing.</li>
  <li><b><i>Standard Library:</i></b> Python comes with a large standard library that provides support for many common tasks such as file I/O, networking, and data manipulation. This 
    reduces the need to rely on third-party libraries for basic functionality.</li>
  <li><b><i>Third-party Libraries:</i></b> In addition to the standard library, Python has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and packages that extend its functionality. These 
    libraries cover a wide range of domains such as web development, data science, machine learning, and more.</li>
  <li><b><i>Platform Independence:</i></b> Python code is typically platform-independent, meaning that it can run on any platform that has a Python interpreter installed. This makes it 
    a versatile language for developing cross-platform applications.</li>
  <li><b><i>Community and Support:</i></b> Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development, create libraries and packages, and provide support 
    through forums, mailing lists, and online communities. This community support is invaluable for learning and troubleshooting.</li>
</ol>

> **_NOTE_** <p aling="justify">To run a Python file using <b>IDLE</b>, which provides a small working environment, you can open it by entering <b>'python -m idlelib.idle <file>'</b> in the 
  terminal</p>
